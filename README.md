Senior Seminar

1/16/24
Approach: 
(Simplified)
-Rank classes based on popularity (Weighted average, 10 points for 1, 5 points for 2, 3 points for 3, 2 points for 4, 1 point for 5)
-Calculate number of duplicate classes (Such that every slot is filled)
-Calculate popularity for the leftover classes
-Arrange so that popular classes are arranged with relatively less popular classes in the same time slot to avoid conflict
-(REMEMBER the duplicate session can not occur at the same time as the original session since there is only one instructor)
-Then, use the students to put into each class
-Delete any uneeded/superflous classes

[POSSIBLE OTHER APPROACH: Separate into main parts, minor parts]
